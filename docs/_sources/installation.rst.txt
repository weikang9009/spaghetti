.. Installation

As of version 1.4.2, `spaghetti` supports Python 3.6_, 3.7_, and 3.8_. Please make sure that you are operating in a Python >= 3.6 environment.

Installation
============

Installing with ``conda`` via `spaghetti-feedstock`_ (highly recommended)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install `spaghetti` and all its dependencies, we recommend using the conda_ manager, specifically with the conda-forge_ channel. This can be obtained by installing the `Anaconda Distribution`_ (a free Python distribution for data science), or through miniconda_ (minimal distribution only containing Python and the ``conda`` package manager). 

Using ``conda``, `spaghetti` can be installed as follows::

  $ conda config --set channel_priority strict
  $ conda install --channel conda-forge spaghetti


Installing with `Python Package Index`_
---------------------------------------
::

  $ pip install spaghetti


*or* download the source distribution (``.tar.gz``) and decompress it to your selected destination. Open a command shell and navigate to the decompressed folder. ::

  $ pip install .

.. role:: rubric

**Warning**

When installing via ``pip``, you have to ensure that the required dependencies for `spaghetti` are installed on your operating system. Details on how to install these packages are linked here_. Using ``conda`` (above) avoids having to install the dependencies separately.
